# shopping-list
User Interface for a sign-up/in and shopping list dashboard. Jawamu is a shopping mart where user can create an account if they do not have one, or sign-in to start shopping. The user should be able to view, edit or delete items from the shopping list by clicking on the items they want. Should the user forget their passwords when trying to sign-in, no hustle, just click on "forgot password", and they will be able to create a new password. Also, one can sign-up using their social media platforms.
